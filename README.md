The Dockerfiles: Single Node Apache Hadoop
=========================

This project is an attempt to create a common starting point for building a single node Hadoop container. The intent of this Dockerfile is to be a template that can be customized and expanded upon based on a user's need rather than an authority on how Hadoop should be configured.

In other words, [please fork me](https://github.com/sticksnleaves/docker-hadoop-single-node/fork).
